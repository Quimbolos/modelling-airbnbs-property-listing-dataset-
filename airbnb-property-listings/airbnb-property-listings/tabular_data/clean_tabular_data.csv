With the nearest mobile signal a ten minute walk awayit‚Äôs a great place to ditch the digital and truly escape. Head over the bridge to your own private deck that happily houses a clever outdoor-kitchen and shower (complete with hot water).

Further afieldthe stunning Elan Valleya landscape bursting with impressive dams and reservoirsis well worthy of an explore. And for those needing supplies - and perhaps a flat white - then the friendly market town of Builth Wells is just down the road.Other things to note.You are entering a remote woodland hideaway for a digital detox: there is very patchy mobile signal and limited internet connectivity.","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Shampoo', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Services', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer']",Llandrindod Wells United Kingdom,2,1.0,1.0,105,4.6,4.7,4.3,5.0,4.3,4.3,13.0,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/26620994?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-03-19&check_out=2022-03-26&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,1,

I do not have any such requirements for the treehouse either. HoweverI am vaccinated and wear a mask in public indoor space.Let‚Äôs all be respectful and kind!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------After your day of hikingskiingor touring local breweries and distilleriescome home to this beautifulprivate tiny house in the trees! Orjust spend the day lazily relaxing by the fire and readingwhile the sound of the stream soothes you.Walk through the woodsup the stairsand enter into another dimension - one that you won\t want to leave! Much thought was put into the design and localnaturaland recycled materials were a priority in its construction.Soak in the curated interior design while you relax in the living room space and gaze out the largerecycled windows (from an oldlocal schoolhouse).Enjoy the deck that overlooks the year-round stream (that may be frozen over in the winter) and let the sound of the water wash through you. You may even see some critters if you\re still enough!There is a sweet sitting areahammockand campfire space just below the treehouse right on the streamwith a dramatic view of the treehouse. And a hanging bed underneath!You can cook simple meals on the propane campstove (with a griddle option) or use the small charcoal grill in the space under the treehouse. There is a mini-fridge with a separate freezer to keep your fresh produce from the farmers\ market and your yummy local beer nice and cool. There\s a very primitive (and limited) water system you can use for washing dishes.We also provide some basic condiments and cooking basicslike olive oil and salt and pepper.

The sleeping space is in a somewhat-tight loftbut the limited space has not been an issue for even our taller guests. We do not allow dogs (or any other pets) in the sleeping loft.This area of Vermont (the Northeast Kingdom) has snow all winterand sometimes mudespecially in the spring. The treehouse is located on a dirt/gravel road that can sometimes be challenging if its muddy or even snowy or icy. We can get a lot of snow sometimes and you could possibly get stuck on your way here or in the driveway. I do my best to keep the driveway clean and sandedbut its not always possible all of the time. We live in a rural area and services are not always immediately available.All of that being saidmost of the time there are no issues but if you have access to a 4WD vehicleideally with higher clearance and snow tiresthat is the best case scenario. Keep an eye on the weather and plan ahead: the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont is probably not like where youre from and being prepared for weather and challenging driving conditions is absolutely the best policy.There is a primitive composting toilet in the treehousewith regular bathroom access (toiletsinkwasherdryershower) in the main housewhich is about 200 feet away.Wifi is not (barely?) available at the treehousebut it is at the house. There is a phone (landline) at the treehouse and minimal/intermittent cell reception.I provide at least two gallons of water that can be used for either drinking and/or washing. I encourage you to fill the water up at the house if you need more than this (there is a faucet option in the shower) rather than bringing in bottles. Our water is great!There is a camping cookstove available (with a griddle)a charcoal grilltoaster oven and a mini-fridge. You should be able to find all you need for basic cooking there.Please understand that you are likely to come across various critters - anything from fairly large spiders (most likely - they love the water) to bears and moose (less likely). Walking down to the treehouse you may come across our resident chipmunkand will often hear owls and loons at night. Soif you want to stay here you must be comfortable with insects and wildlife!

We donate a large portion of your payment to local non-profits and thank you for being a positive part of our community.~~Heres your chance to fulfill that childhood dream of running away and camping out in a treehouse. This is not a tiny house wrapped around a tree or a glamorous treehouse complete with running water and a kitchen. Insteadthis is an authentic treehouse that we built for our nephew in 2014complete with reclaimed redwood walls and windows from our old house. Its an authentic kid-like treehouse experience; a space devoted to the stuff of childhood dreams.LOCATION: The Trailside Treehouse is centrally located in RichmondVirginiajust minutes from I-95 and I-64. It is directly across the river from one of Richmonds popular parks called Maymont. The James River Park System and Buttermilk Trail also come through the propertythanks to an easement we have given the city. The treehouse property itself includes five wooded acres with nationally-celebrated single-track trail and is adjacent to the river--just hike down the trail and cross a single train track and youll find some of Richmonds best fishing and swimming!THE SPACE: As we designed the treehouse spacewe asked ourselves one question: what would we have wanted in a treehouse as kids? The Trailside Treehouse is our answer to that question--its a magnum opus to childhood.Please note: There is a zipline on the property. Per our insurance companyguests are not allowed to use it. Please prepare your children ahead of time so theyre not bummed when they arrive!WHAT TO EXPECT: The treehouse isn‚Äôt an inexpensive place to stay.

Insteadit‚Äôs an unparalleled experience that we hope transforms our guests by bringing them back to their childlike centers. It‚Äôs a place to practice juggling or learn new yo-yo tricks. It‚Äôs a place to flip through a book about bowling rules and get curious about things you haven‚Äôt wondered about since you were a kid. There are notes to discover in the nooks and crannies. There are games you may not have played with since you were a child. Theres a bin of junk food and a fridge with sodas. Weve stocked the treehouse with activities that we hope reminds you of the curiosity you had as a child.

Please note that cell phone service is limited to texting and sometimes a phone call.There is a composting toilet which is very modern and clean but you need to follow the directions that are clearly posted.There is hot and cold water for a kitchen sinkand an outside shower.Because the treehouse is in the woodsnature will take over when it cani.e. mice may come in in the fall to try and nest in warm places in Vermont. We hope that you do not leave food around to entice them. We monitor mouse traps so you will not have to deal with that.Sometimes some rainwater may come down the large inside tree if it is windy and raining hard. We provide towels to put on the floor around the tree if this happens. (It stays in a small area around the tree).If you have small childrenwe trust that you will take responsibility for them. Please monitor them on the loft stairshelp them to use the toilet properlyand don‚Äôt let them take food away from the dining tables that are inside and on the deck.Being mindful of being in nature will help prevent miceantsand bugs and it will help us to keep the treehouse clean and smelling fresh.We have an organic farm and respect nature and do not want to be wasteful.

Surrounded by the wilderness of the Green Mountain National Forest and perched high above the ground in three maples treesthere is no place better to escape to. There are so many things to do in this area between Killington and SugarbushI cant list them all! Between the cozy bed and in-house massage therapist you probably won‚Äôt want to leave anyway.

With the treehouse being located in a forest the walking path can be a bit muddybumpysnow coveredperfectof a combination of everything so please bring appropriate footwear.We expect to clean the treehouse after each guest so there is no additional cleaning feebut if you leave a mess we will contact you and ask for a cleaning fee.We love animals and enjoy when guests gets to bring theirs! We just do not like cleaning up after those furry family members so we are asking for you to bring a bed or blanket for the furry one to sleep on. We do have a fee of $20 per day per pet for normal wear and tear. Airbnb is set up to charge you for the first nightbut any more nights will be added manually. This fee does not include any extra cleaning or damage to the treehouse. If you bring a pet with out telling us a head of timewe will add on $50 since we use different linens when pets are visiting and won‚Äôt be able to change them out on your arrival. (I do apologize if this sounds over the top in anywaya few bad apples are why we had to implement such things).Please let us know your estimated time of arrival on arrival day so I know when to come down from the trees and keep an eye out. Showing up without giving me a heads up could cause up to an hour wait time until I can get you checked in since I could be in the middle of a project in the forest.We try to be as accommodating as possible by having a 4 hour check in windowif you want to check in out side of that time frame we will do so to the best of our abilities at a charge of $30 per hour.The bathroom consists of a composting toilet which is on the same treehouse platform. We have a seasonal heated outdoor shower which is operational in the warmer months. We will provide you with some drinking water in a bottle and hand sanitizer.The treehouse is well insulated and has electric heaters that will keep you plenty warm on the coldest of Vermont nights.For those that want to disconnect while still being able to connect we now have internet and a small smart tv in this treehouse!We will help bring your belongings up to the treehouse upon your arrival but can not guarantee help bringing them back down as we both work in the mornings.We want to make sure everyone who visits our treehouse knows what they are booking by reading the description and not just our glorious reviews because the experience at our treehouse is not for everyone.

The Tree houses are our dream come true. We both wanted treehouses at a young age. For me being in nature brings me peace. When I was 9 I would play in the woods with my siblings and build my tree house with small branchesusing rocks as our furniture and moss as our carpet. I never let go of having this space and thought about it often.When Bill and I started our dream company EarthJOY Tree adventures in 2007. Whereas we take clients to the top of trees on ropes. As part of this venture we wanted to give them another experience. Why not be able to stay in a treehouse too??We set off to take Pete Nelsons LEARN HOW TO BUILD A TREEHOUSE in 2009 workshop.After the workshop we looked high and low for the perfect property to have this dream come true. We ran into many obstacles one being not able to afford it or not the right trees.When we saw Pete on Animal planet I thought I would just apply for the fun of it. We didn\t even have a place. When they called and accepted our application I called Dad. I asked him if we could build a treehouse on his 200 acre farm. He laughed and then said YES! He said he was tired of running two farms and would now change gears to have a few tree houses.In 2017 we built our second tree house. This one you are reading about!IN 2019 we finished our third tree house built by Bill ~ co-owner and my husband. He put love into every single nail and board. It is unique in that it has play elements like a slide2 swings and double loft. He made 50% of the tree house from the land itself using cedars and re-purposed wood and roof from one of the old farmhouses .*** Important *** No RESCHEDULES or CANCELLATIONS within 30 days of your stay!

Traditional Costa Rican meals can be delivered from a local caterer for very reasonable prices (Costa Rican food is tasty but not spicy). Otherwisefor those without carswe can call a taxi or try to synchronize a food shopping trip when we go to town for errands.Three hours of daylight are needed to safely drive here from the SJO airport before sunset at 5:30 pm. The drive through mountainous cloud forests is splendid in daylightbut prone to fog and rainespecially at nightcreating hazardous visibility conditions after dark. Finding our countryside location will also be far easier if you arrive the first time before sunset.

Day visitors must leave by 6 pmand only casita and Tree House guests may use the pools after 6 pm and enjoy unlimited access to the poolswith the exception of no nighttime use of the forest poolsand cleaning schedule as noted above.We recommend either ordering a catered dinner in advance for your first evening and/or next morning breakfastor buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on Costa Rican roads. Alsomost guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner. We provide a Catering Menu to each guest once reservedbut the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and TIMES guests would like meals delivered. We do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beer/wine/rum etc. The tap water is safe to drinkand we sell soft drinksfruit juicesand other non-alcohol beveragessnacks and ice cream.","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Shampoo', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Home safety', 'Fire extinguisher', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Pool', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Host greets you', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'This place may not have a smoke detector.

Place has been cleaned and disinfected with commercial-grade cleaning products.#############################A simpleyet comfortable small shaker cabin placed in the middle of the Massanutten Mountain with views to die for of the Shenandoah River and National Park. Wake up to the sight of the magnificent ""Blue Ridge Mountains"" and the town of LurayVA from 1,500 feet.The spaceThe space.We debated long and hard whether to list this place on airbnb. After allthis is our hideawaywith a view that regretfully only a few will ever get to enjoy. But because we love it so muchand in the spirit of the sharing economywe felt compelled to open its doors to others and allow you to experience the wonderful warmth that this small and rustic cabin will bring to your soulyour heart and your sight. While hereevery sense is liftedevery smell improvedevery sound a symphony.If you\re looking for modern comfort and the latest gadgetsthis is not your place. Insteadif you want to warm yourself upyou\ll need to place wood in the stove. If you want to check the latest stock pricesyou\ll need to call your broker because Internet is NOT available. If you want to watch TV in your roomplease look elsewhere.Howeverif you prefer to wake up to the most extraordinary sunrise in your lifesimply sleep on the futon couch and open up your eyes in the early morning. If you find delight while hearing the buzz of a hummingbirdjust place a few seeds in the balcony. If you want to reconnect with your inner selfseat in one of the shaker rocking chairspull up your legs and open that book you always wanted to complete. If you\re luckyyou may even see a black bear or two roaming around (no worriesthey are not dangerous).The Cabin is located at about 1,500 feet overlooking the Shenandoah Riverthe town of Lurayand the ""Blue Ridge Mountains."" The view is a feast to the eyesight. But don\t stop there. Visit the Luray Caverns6 minutes at the bottom of the hills. Hike to your heart\s content on the Massanutten (Stephen) Trail a mile above or in one of the dozens other nearby paths. Bring a road bike and challenge yourself to the top of the mountain. Go horse back riding. Explore the Virginia wine country. Or just..relax.Welcome to a place where time has finally slowed down!Other things to note.Q & A:Q: Why do you rent this place?.A: We use it one month per year at most. Why keep this jewel to ourselves? Please enjoy it as if it\s your place as well.Q: Why is there no Internet?.A: I work in the high-tech sector. I am connected 24/7. I wanted a place where time stands stillbe close to natureand could truly get away from it all. We want to share not only the placebut the experience as well.Q: What if I need something from you?.A: Just send me a text message or give me a ring. You\ll get my number after your booking is confirmed.Q: The fridge is very smallwill we starve to death?.A: Heyno drama here. Yesthe fridge is smallbut there is also an ice cooler you may use. Simply bring your own ice and please drain it before leaving. That should keep you alive for a bit longer :-)Q: Should I bring sheets and towels?.A: No worries. We will provide bedding and towelsblanketssoapshampoo and toilet paper. If you need anything elseplease let me know and I will do anything in my power to have it ready before your arrival.Q. Nice wood stovedo I can have to purchase firewood?.A. No need to do so. I usually provide plenty of firewood for my guests. You may find it in the back deck. Please cover the wood with the tarp after you\re done to protect it from the rain and allow other guests to warm themselves too :-)Q: I love this placecan I extend my stay?.A: If availablesureknock yourself out. Simply get to an internet cafe or use your smart phone and book again. But please contact me beforehand out of courtesy.Q: Great decorationwhat style is it?.A: Shaker style. From wikipedia""Shaker furniture is a distinctive style of furniture developed by the United Society of Believers in Christ\s Second Appearingcommonly known as Shakersa religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicityutility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs."" We are not shakersbut we are guided by the same principles.Q. What\s the sleeping situation?.A. Wellyou\re welcome to sleep any way you\d like :-) But to be more specificthere are two bedroomsboth with full-size beds. One bedroom has a platform bed with a memory foam mattressand the other one a Murphy bed with a memory foam topper. There are also two full-size futons located next to the stove in the living room. If you\re not into futonsthere is also a comfy inflatable full-size bed found in the closet where the Murphy bed is. Please take your pick.Q. There are no bathroom faucets!.A. Mmmthat wasn\t a questionbut yes they\re there. These faucets and vanity were a DIY project of my own design using copper piping and shut-off valves and reclaimed wood. Just turn the valves one quarter of the way counterclockwise to open the water supply. Pretty coolhugh?Q. Is the Cabin self-sustainable?.A. Not yetbut I\m working on it. With your booking contributionI created a system to capture rain water to the cistern below (the mountain is dry and water is a precious commodity here)and eventually I will install solar panels on the roof. Currentlyall waste water goes into a septic tankso as soon as I implement the above stepsthe Cabin will technically be able to be off-grid.Q. What other environmental measures have you implemented?.A. In addition to capturing water from rain and eventually energy from the sunI have renovated the bathroom and kitchen using reclaimed woodsome of it from a nearby old farm. The dish and body soaps and most house-cleaning products are environmentally-friendly to help natural decomposition of waste water in the septic system. The floor is made up of natural cork and woodand the entire place was recently re-insulated to improve energy efficiency. If you\d like to know more about our eco-effortsplease contact me.Q. Why are there so many water jugs in the kitchen?.A. Drinking water in colorful jugsas well as the 5-gal dispenser just outside the kitchencomes from a nearby natural water spring (best tasting water I ever had). I leave plenty of it for you because TAP water is NOT potable. In factI ask my guests to be mindful of tap water usage because there is no well or city-piped water source. Insteadwater is collected to a cistern below from rain or trucked in (by me) if need be. It is therefore a precious commodity. Simply shut off faucets when not in usebe careful not to leave the toilet runningand take shorter showers if possible. That\s it! :-)Q. How is the house heated?.A. The main source of heat is the wood stove. You\ll be surprise how efficient this rustic appliance is. Depending on the tempit may take a couple of hours to bring the thermometer up to your standardso exercise a little patience. There is a heat-infused fan and a tea pot on top of the stove. The fan will propagate the heat efficiently and the tea pot (with water) will act as a natural humidifiermaking you more comfortable. In additionthere is a wall heater in the kitchen (dial) and another one in the bathroom (switch) that you can control. Finallya baseboard heater in the entrance hallway will keep the bedrooms (and water pipes) warm. In shortyou\ll be cozy!Q. OKso I will be warm in winter. What about the height of the summer heat?.A. Ohyou\ll will be warm in summer alright :-) But seriouslythere is an old and fairly inefficient AC wall unit in the dining room. There is also a ceiling fan in the living room and another one in one of the bedrooms. I\ve found that opening the windows creates a nice airflow that cools the place down. But if you\re looking for a in-house refrigeratorthis small cabin may not be for you.Q. What\s the deal with you being a Superhost?.A. Well thensince you ask..I\m a Superhost because we\re relaxed about our guests despite us having full-time jobs of our own. HoweverI\ve come to be rather fond of that ""title,"" and I don\t appreciate when a guest leaves a review saying that the place was too isolatedor that the place was not what they expected (there\s only about 40 pictures). If a guest does not read the detailed description where I specify the exact distance to placesor the meticulous portrayal of the houseor whateverthen their reviews should be kinder. I truly enjoy 5-star reviews. If there\s something you do not like while hereI beg you to let me know and I promise to do what I can to revert your perspective.

At Xmas/ New Year/ Bank Hols longer min stay applies.The space""The space.* COVID-19 Update: Airbnb have imposed a Covid Sanitisation Clean between each booking and this is mandatory. We are now having to apply a cleaning fee to all bookings to cover this. Due to the remote nature of the cabin this requires a 20 mile round trip for a cleaner. This is to cover the Sanitisation Clean only and guests are still required to clean up after themselves during their stay. Cleaning products are provided.* Please Note - For hygiene reasonswe dont provide any linens/ beddingincluding bed sheetspillowsduvets and towels (+ tea towels & cleaning cloths). Guests will need to bring their own.We are very fond of our little Cabin and have aimed to create somewhere that is well equippedwelcoming andas many of our guests saya Home from Home. We certainly love spending time there as an escape from everyday life and we hope you‚Äôll love it as much as we do!Our self catering cabin was fully refurbished in 2016 and has a fully equipped kitchen & living area with TV & Freesat2 bedrooms - 1 double & 1 single (note this is a fold out single bed) and a shower room.The kitchen should be fully equipped with all you need to make a 3 course dinner or just a nice bacon sarnie in the morning. We try to keep the cupboards stocked with a few basics ‚Äì coffeeteaTomato KetchupSalt & Pepper etc ‚Äì just in case! There is a small shop on site if you need any basic supplies too.At the start of 2017 the cabin had a newfully insulated external cladding added to it & in late 2019 we had the roof insulated also which is keeping everyone warmer in Winter and cooler in Summer. Howeverplease remember that cabin is a simple wood construction so it most likely wont be as warm in Winter as your home is so we do ask people to pack a few warmer clothes (& definitely some Slippers!) and maybe use it as an excuse to get cosy under a blanket with someone!Mobile signal has improved drastically in the past few years and we are able to easily stream films & shows to our devices using 4G - perfect for a lazy day in bed! Weve also been able to work remotely here as the connection is strong enough to support video calls.We also have a large supply of DVDs and books in the cabin for cold or wet days that you might not want to go out - so stay in and curl up on our big sofas!""""Guest access.The place is all yours during your stay and in addition to this theres a small shoplaunderette (great after a day mountain biking or hill walking) & well equipped playground on site. Sadly the pub on site was devastated by a huge fire in Oct 2018 and will be closed for the foreseeable future whilst it is rebuilt. As its Grade II listed thoughthis is taking some time to get sorted.We can recommend alternative venues and taxis. Please ask us for more info or check the guidebook at the Cabin.Larger shops / supermarkets and all tourist attractions are accessible by car. Most things are about 20 mins drive away (a perfect opportunity to take in the scenery!). There is a dedicated space for car parking right outside the cabin so parking should never be an issue.""""Other things to note.Check in is at 3 pm and Check out is at Midday.At the cabin itself theres no Wifi currently due to the location. There is a mobile mast on the site now though so Mobile signal has been greatly improved and is good enough to stream SkyNetflix etc or work remotely and do video calls.Due to restrictions from Snowdonia National Park we are obliged to close for the month of November.We require ALL guests to have a history of positive feedback from previous hosts so please note if you are new to Airbnb or have little/no reviews we are unlikely to accept your booking. As we are not on site we like to have extra confidence in the bookings - please dont take this personally!""","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Hangers', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV with standard cable/satellite', 'Books and reading material', 'Heating and cooling', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Kettle', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Baking sheet', 'Coffee', 'Dining table', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Launderette nearby', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard ‚Äì Not fully fenced', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Single level home', 'No stairs in home', 'Services', 'Self check-in', 'Cleaning before checkout', 'Lockbox', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Essentials\nEssentials', 'Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'This place may not have a carbon monoxide detector.

There are stunning views of Dartmoor from your deckingwhere you can enjoy a glass of wine on the sofasurrounded by fur rugs & pillows.The combination of Beaches and Moorland are beautiful areas to explore with something for everyone!Alternativelylisten to the crackle of the log burner whilst peacefully watching your favourite movies.""The spaceThe space.You are situated in a sheltered sunny valley where you can look down on the birds of prey flying around and the lambs chasing each other. It is so very peaceful and relaxing sat on the decking soaking up the view.It is great to get away from it all but in case of rainy daysthere is also a wall mounted TV which has no arealonly TV via the internet so you can enjoy net flicks/amazon prime etc. Occasionally we can have a poor signal due to being so ruralbut most of the time it works fine! There is WIFI in the Log Cabin.The log cabin is a 20minute walk outside the village and quite rural. Take care driving on the lanes as they are quite narrow and challenging at times. Late summer into Autumn is when the farmers cut the hedges which can be frustrating as this reduces the beautiful view. But this is not for long and the peace and tranquillity is still surrounding you.Dogs are very welcome; it is the perfect place for wonderful walks across Dartmoor National Park. The garden should be secure and private for them unless they are small enough to climb through the gate! Please let me know if you are bringing one on your booking. There is a small charge of ¬£10 per stay if you have one or two dogs (if you have more than two dogs I would be grateful if you would contact me first).There is an outdoor bath for twoin a private garden so you can look up at the stars.This is my favourite place but it is not for everyone! This is part of your log cabin and included in the price.There is a hot tub next door which is available occasionallyif my cottage is not booked.Please feel free to ask and if it is available it is ¬£25 for a two hour session. I will only be able to confirm its availability when you have arrived.My guest tell me they are loving the bath and would rather it to the hot tub!""Other things to note.Well behaved Dogs are very welcome. There is a hose and a dog gate to help you keep them clean and dry. If you could bring your own dog beds and keep them off your bed and the sofa I would be most grateful.The double sofa bed is small which is why I have allowed for only one guest but it can fit two. If you want a fourth person to stay it is an extra ¬£10 a night.If you do use the sofa bed I am afraid you cannot use the log burning stove as the bed gets too close - you do not need it for heating as there is a radiator anyway - but it looks and smells lovely if there is just two of you.There is an outside field kitchen under cover which consists of an small oventwo hot plates and a chicken rotisserie (which is amazing!). I am very grateful if you could leave this clean on departure to avoid a cleaning fee. There is a small combination microwave/cooker/grill inside the log cabin too.The bathroom is heated by the sun and has a wonderfully hot shower in an openrusticwet room - it is surprisingly pleasurable! The Eco Loo is a type of waterless toilet that separates urine from solid waste. Urine can is diverted through a flexible pipe to an external soak away area. This is cleaned and made fresh for all my guests and is environmentally friendly.You have your own two person external bath which is hidden away in your private garden with fairy lights and candles - a wonderful experience you simply must try!There is a fire pit that you can sit around in your gardenyou will need to bring your own logs for this. Great for roasting marshmallows and can be used to bbq food but you will need to bring your own charcoal and there is no temperature control so can be challenging..OccasionallyI rent out my cottage next door too.""","['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Valley view', 'Garden view', 'Bathroom', 'Bath', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Shampoo', 'Conditioner', 'Body soap', 'Outdoor shower', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Iron', 'Clothes drying rack', 'Clothes storage', 'Entertainment', 'Ethernet connection', 'TV', 'Sound system', 'Family', 'Board games', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Freezer', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Kettle', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Coffee', 'Dining table', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard ‚Äì Fully fenced', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Outdoor kitchen', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Private hot tub', 'Single level home', 'No stairs in home', 'Services', 'Pets allowed', 'Assistance animals are always allowed', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']",Bridford England United Kingdom,3,2.0,1.0,88,4.9,4.8,4.9,4.9,4.9,4.7,60.0,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/37043256?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A5348&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-09-04&check_out=2022-09-11&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=71a42043-b9f0-4515-b1e3-06111fdaf636,1,

606,1e308ef0-d2a6-4563-a105-3bfb693c09ac,Amazing pools,The Shed,"The Property:The Shed is named somewhat tongue in cheek by the owners\ family as it is about as far from a shed as you can get. Whether sitting out on the decking with its clear view glass balustrade or in the comfort of the lounge you have stunning views across Avon Beach and the Solent to the Isle of Wight and The Needles; there is always something to watch at any time of year. When you talk about a property one of the most important factors is location. New for 2015the chalet has it all from its prime sea front position to its proximity to such places as the beautiful New ForestBournemouthLymington and Christchurch. There is so much to do right on your doorstep or within a very short drive.The Shed is fully equipped to a high standard with all you need to make your stay one of comfort and luxury. There is a dishwasher ""so no arguments over the washing up!""separate fridge and freezermicrowave and extra touches like a built in coffee makerBose Sounddock and TVs in both bedrooms. You have private parking adjacent to the chalet so you do not have to haul your luggage and shopping far.The Shed is based within the boutique Sandhills Holiday Park. With its historic main house and leafy grounds the whole ambiance is one of relaxing in the country but with the sights and sounds of the sea. The park facilities are available to all guests and include an adventure playgroundfamily bar with Sky TVheated outdoor poolsmall gymnasiumpool tablelaunderette and mini mart store. Additionally there is free WiFi in the lounge and bar areas.About the Local area:.Christchurch was a renowned smuggling town and \The Shed\ is just a short walk from the historic Mudeford Quay where in 1784 smugglers skirmished with Customs and Excise officers. So kids bring those cutlasseseye patches and skull and crossbonesoh and a parrot if you have one!It is still a working quay today with fishing boats venturing out most days so why not say hello to Pete on boat Deja Vu (SU21) and see how his day has beenor wave to him from your decking as he heads back from another successful day out. If you fancy testing your skills out and bringing the catch home yourself pleasure fishing trips are available directly from the quayor we can help you organise in advance. There are many pleasure trips to be had or if you fancy a thrill then why not hang on to your seats on the Bay Blast rib ride.The Quay is also famous for its crabbing from the quayside (crabbers quay!) and has a children\s play parkfish stallcafeThe Haven House Inn and a large green area which is perfect for picnicsball games and kite flying. You can catch the ferry to Hengistbury Head directly from the Quay and visit its fantastic beaches and beach huts.Christchurch harbour is a great place for watersports from windsurfing to sailing and the Highcliffe sailing club is based on the Quay. There is also an active RNLI lifeboat station which practices launching weekly so you are almost bound to see their rather unusual lifeboat launch and recovery system in action!If walking or bird watching is your thing then you can do both without even getting in the car. Within an easy stroll you will find a nature reserve on the cliff top adjacent to Highcliffe Castle. If you fancy a little longer out then why not try the circular walk through Stanpit Marshes and on to Christchurch for a spot of lunch. Then take the Tuckton ferry from outside the Captains Club to cross the riveror walk over Tuckton bridge a little further on if the ferry is not runningand head across more picturesque marshes to the back of Hengistbury Head. From there you can skirt the inside shorelinehead up and over the top or use the beach as your route back to the beach huts and ferry home at the tip of the Head.

Dont let the unusual openness of the space deter youthis is an experience you wont soon forget.Bali 101:.Welcome to Balino this is not like where you are coming from. To hopefully enhance your experience we want to provide you with a bit of cultural context. People often feel disappointed when they try to make Bali what they are familiar with. We hope by describing a few scenarios that this helps as Bali has things about it that may be very different than you are used to.1. ‚ÄúThere is a lizard staring at me from the ceiling who pooped on the floor and there are ants crawling along the wall in the bathroom‚Äù The outdoors will come inside. Cricketsspidersand certainly a resident gecko and wasps will all join you in your living space. No matter how fancy the villa there is no keeping them out. Given that all of our bathrooms are open air this is something to embrace as part of the experience and not be afraid as they are all harmless.2. ‚ÄúI can hear roosters and dogs and the temple and even the occasional pig being sacrificed at midnightoh and the crickets are too loud to sleep.‚Äù Yes indeedall true. When I think of Bali I think of roostersthey are very proud of their fighting cocks and spend a great deal of time with themoften keeping them quite close to living spaces so your neighbor may very well have one. our neighbor certainly has both and his dog barks a lot and has attempted to scare away many a guest but dont be afraid he is harmless. The temple is a charming sound that echo thru the night and adds the to atmosphere but it can be less charming when they begin to sacrifice pigs at midnight. Peaceful Bali? Well its all a matter of perspective bali is here to be itself not just to be a peaceful place for you to relaxenjoy these new and unique sounds as part of the atmosphere and dont expect it to be an instagram photoit is a real living place.3. ‚ÄúAn old lady with a machete and no shirt on just wandered into my living room‚Äù Balinese have a very different relationship to personal privacy than we do. It is not uncommon for neighbors or rice-field farms to wander into your space and personal property. because they are curious about you or simply because they want to borrow your sugar. They may not even ask as they would imagine you would do exactly the same. This can be very startling at first and takes some getting used to. You are welcome to ask them to leave but do keep in mind they are more than likely not there to harm you just used to sharing personal space.4. ‚ÄúThere are naked people in the stream by the house‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt very many years ago that all Balinese women were topless as their normal daily attire. Now only the traditional old women still maintain this style of dress but it is still very common to see people publicly bathing in ricefield streams naked. You may even see this from your front porch. Don‚Äôt be alarmed this normal here and they will not even feel embarrassed if you wave \uf04a.5. ‚ÄúThe guy tried to over charge me‚Äù there is a very different relationship to money here. Think of it as a tug of war with a rope in the middleit‚Äôs not that they are trying to steal from you or cheat you or have anything against you at all they are just pulling on the rope to get as much money as they canif you don‚Äôt tug back then they won. Don‚Äôt get angry or feel the need to have hurt feelings just negotiate calmly to lower the price to something fairer. Negotiate everything in every situationyou will use these skills later when you need to ask for a raise with your boss. ;).6. ‚Äúeverything is damp‚Äù yes this is the tropics and especially during the rainy season everything can feel a bit damp and can mildew quickly even within a day. If your clothes need fresh laundering after being in a suitcase or if the sheets need to be changed for this reason just let us know and we will assist you.We hope these scenarios help you to be prepared if you face them and feel free to let us know should you need additional help navigating in this new environment. Also please be aware that this is a house with two cats who live therewe very much want to host people who are cat friendly as the cats are very much running the resort and we want you to be able to include them in your stay.""","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Iron', 'Home safety', 'Fire extinguisher', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Outdoor', 'Patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free on-street parking', 'Pool', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Host greets you', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Kitchen\nKitchen', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'This place may not have a smoke detector.

It is one of a kind in architecture and theme with colored bottles built into the wallstained glass windowscenter tree pillar with atrium windows aboveand medieval Celtic Cross above the Hobbit Hole (outside and atop) give it a Hobbit Church feel.The spaceThe space.Heads up -- one of our Hobbit front door hinges just broke. darn it. Just a heads up. It usually takes a couple weeks to get a welder out here for such fixits.This is a primitive cabinit DOES have running waterbut NO electricity (you bring your own candles BYOC). Common facilities (kitchen and bath) being shared with the larger communityabout 200 yds away.*Just so everyone knowsduring heavy rains in our RainForest winter monthssometimes the floor can get a little wet and the underground cave can be damp --Utilizing the wood stove is ideal (please bring some firewood) keeps it drier and warmer.Breakfast nook has a Hobbit mushroom table and there is a comfy sky chair suspended for luxuriating.Built into the side of a mountain with a seasonal spring (there are springs everywhere here in the mountainous rain forest) that runs through the house -- on purpose -- so there is often the sound of a babbling brook in the HH November thru May.If you are looking for a unique experience in a beautiful natural area and would like to experience life in an off-gridsustainablepermaculture-focused ecovillage - and all the rough roadsdirtmudinsectsmessesbarking dogsmosquitosbeesmiceearly morning roosterscommunal livingcomposting toiletsongoing construction projects in remote wilderness - then we invite you join us in our mountain village!Our property encompasses 160 acres of pristine natural wilderness in Northern California\s beautiful Smith River canyon - home of the only un-dammed river in the state. Lush fern-encrusted hillsides slope down to countless spring-fed streamsteeming with wildlifefrom cute caterpillars to (also cutesometimes!) black bears. Accessible only by forestry road from scenic Redwoon Hwy (CA-199,) this is an opportunity to experience our responsible natural relationship with Mother Earth.This location is very beautiful and quite remoteso please be sure you\ve read through the full description and are prepared for certain elements of ""roughing it"" and adventure travel. The Village is also a work-in-progress so we are likely to be working and there may be constructiondirtand messes around!Amenities:BEDDING. It seems weird and unnecessary to mehonestlybut (bending to some COVID requests) we are asking you to bring your own sheets/sleeping bagsetc. There will be a mattress padblanket and some sheets in a drawer if you really need/want them. We\ll call it a rustic cabin theme instead of a paranoid germophobe motif.‚Ä¢Lighting / Electricity: Your cabin does not have electricity; we try to keep a flashlightlanternand/or candle available for your use -- but we recommend that you bring your own lights.‚Ä¢Kitchen: The outdoor kitchenabout 200yds away from the Hobbit Holehas a small propane camping stoveand plenty of potspansand utensils for your use. We do not have refrigeration but we do have a freezer (with ice packs) and coolers for storing food.‚Ä¢Bathrooms: We use composting toilets (buckets with seats); there is an indoor toilet in the bathhouse. Hot shower in the sauna/bathhouse. It is about 200 yds on average away from most of our cabins.‚Ä¢(Lack of) Phone / Internet: Some Verizon and US Cellular service is availablebut AT&T and T-Mobile do not service our area. We do not have wifi.The Great Outdoors:.‚Ä¢Domestic animals: Between the three dogs who run around at night chasing forest creaturesspringtime frog concertsand the early-rising chickensit is likely that there will be some animal noises occurring at unpredictable moments during the night and day.‚Ä¢Wild animals: There are various of these that live in the forestincluding skunkschipmunksfoxesblack bearsand many birds and insects. Since we have dogs and people aroundthe wild animals tend to keep their distance from the areas that we use. If you are luckyyou might spot a black bear on a hike; they are basically like big raccoons and prefer to run away from humans.If you are looking for a unique experience and up for rustic accommodations with a few off-grid perkswe welcome you to join us in our mountain paradise!Guest access.There is no key (or lock) to the Hobbit Hole. Just head up (the road) to the Lower Village common area. The Hobbit Hole is the first structure -- before the treehouse -- and just past the parking area on the right. Someone will probably be there to show you about the common areas -- otherwisejust make yourself at home. It\s casualnot formal.The Hobbit House is quite private and the furthest away from amenities in our Village. We provide a portable composting toilet. Our dining hallbath house (with showerbidetand fancier indoor toilet) is about 200 yds away.There are plenty trails to hikea swimming holeand garden benches and porch swings to enjoy the view.The host (Dan) is sometimes aroundsometimes notoften busy doing stuffso it\s all pretty straight forward check in yourself (no key or lock) make yourself at homecommunity areas are obvious. But there\s almost always someone around (other residentsintern woofers) to answer questions if you have them.There is a wood-fired sauna (usable November thru May)large organic garden and edible landscapingchicken and goat pensother animal residents include dogscatschickensfish and frogs.From your cabinyou are welcome to wander at will amongst our 160 acres of mostly steepforested landand enjoy the streams and waterfalls leading into Little Jones Creek. A stroll down the"" driveway"" and back along the forestry road is a beautiful hike in itselfwhere you could easily spend all day in the company of only quiet woodland creatures.We also offer custom bodywork sessions - holistic chiropractic and massage - more info available on request.Other things to note.Driving here: You do NOT need 4WD or any special vehicle to reach our property. We drive in and out regularly in our small Honda hatchback and have had hundreds of visitors drive up in their ""regular"" cars. Indeed the forestry road has a few potholes worth slowing to 5mphbut otherwise can be driven at 20mph. The rainy winter season creates puddles but actually better traction than in summercounter intuitively. The bridge ramps narrow and all you need to do is drive it slowlyconsciously. Pretty easy.Note: Plenty of people have very relaxingenjoyable satisfying experiences here in our sustainable culture experimentbut this happens only when reality exceeds expectations. This is where I try to talk everyone out of coming to stay with us -- MMV is NOTHING like a resort or the Marriott hotel. Think some crazy combination of camping/glamping at a ruggedmountainousoff-gridremote farm and sustainable community. There may be a compost pile outside your cabin after we weed the the beds around it. Our goatschickens or dogs may wake you in the morning. There are all kinds of critters here including but not limited to spiders and bears and all in between. We live here and make messesundertake all kinds of projects including big building projects sometimes. It is NOT polishednot always tidy (although we really try) convenient or even (sometimes) comfortable. You may have to split your own firewood. There is plenty of raw beauty and these forementioned functionalities are how it is here as we continue working towards Shangri La!.We love our visitors and appreciate them -- if you want to understand more about our project -- visitjoin and/or support us -- search Maitreya Mountain Village","['What this place offers', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Hot tub', 'Services', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'This place may not have a smoke detector.

747,d42233a7-5bfb-42e0-a3bb-85b85ba5f28d,Offbeat,WORLDS GREATEST BEACH HOUSE,"WORLDS GREATEST BEACH HOUSEThe space""The space.Southern California is more than just a lifestyleit is a vibea connectiona mood and most of all a glorious undertaking in enjoying all life has to offer in a great climate bounded by sunsurf and sand. We humbly submit that if you rent this homeyou will agree that from the desert to the sea throughout the entire state there isquite simplyno finer home to experience the dream of southern California. Buckle up folksyou are about to enter the Water Tower Experience.(For a video of the homeplease click on the video box in the photo montage)The name says it all ‚Äì THE WATER TOWER - for the those unfamiliar with perhaps the most famous beach-front landmark in all of Californialet‚Äôs start with a little history. Located in one of Americas tallest ground to ceiling residential structures and serviced by a commercial elevator that whisks you upwards of close to one hundred feet in the sky; this almost 3,000 square foot home wasin factsouthern Californias first man-made tourist attraction. Long before Knotts and Disneylandindeedbefore the first automobile was registered in Orange Countythe Water Tower stood marveled at by visitors and locals alike as a wonder of engineering and architectural bravado.As for the structureit stands over 85 feet tall and has three stories with windows on all sides. This amazing home is beyond well-appointedit has been professionally renovated and decorated with first class amenitiesappliancesthousand-thread count linens and top-shelf accoutrementsso that your experience in southern California beach living is not only first-class in every conceivable waybut a memory you treasure forever. No detail has gone unnoticed as the owners endeavored to create a home that will reward every person who enters an indelible lifetime memory. The interior designers charge was simple; pay tribute to the history of the Water Tower and when finished we wanted every guest who stays in the home to leave and tell everyone they know about the magic of the Water Tower Experience. As you can see from the photoswe believe the decorators and designers hit this one out of the park. The home has two garagesan elevatorfour bedroomsthree and one-half bathroomsa fully stocked kitchenbarlaundry room and the most amazing living room you will likely ever encounter with 360 degree views of southern California and beyond.Now that we have the structure out of the waylet‚Äôs get to the fun stuff ‚Äì the Water Tower Experience ‚Äì as natives knowthe debate has raged for years over what is more ‚ÄúSo Cal‚ÄùOrange County and its miles of pristine beaches or LA with a bit more trafficbut mountains and beaches and a whole lot of glitz. As you enter the Water Tower Experience this won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äì you are part of both. Tower localshowevermight argue as to whether or not she resides in Sunset Beach or Seal Beach as they both claim her. It really doesn‚Äôt matter asmake no mistake about itwhilelike the beachesthe Water Tower belongs to all Californians. It is the love child of Sunset Beachbut Seal Beach is very much the proud Father. As you stand on the sidewalkplease take a moment to look up and take in the grandeur of this magnificent 19th century landmark which was once the tallest structure in Orange County and today stands as the second tallest residential home in the United States.As you enter you will see the fine artwork on the doors and plaque detailing some of the history of this home which was built to service the railroads in the last half of the 1800‚Äôs as the steam engines required a tremendous amount of water to power the locomotives. The Tower could hold up to 75,000 gallons of water which weighed over 37 tons so don‚Äôt worry about whether or not the she is strong enough to support your family. The entry way is a tribute to the Tower and the workers who built her. From vintage tools and a water fall to the Burlaps and Barrels bathroom you will feel the history of the Water Tower as soon as you cross the threshold into a home experience like non-other. You will also be introduced to the tower mascot ‚Äì Mr. Wally Tower. As your stay unfoldsenjoy finding the hidden ‚ÄúWally‚Äôs‚Äù around the home. There are several intriguing finds on this floor including a bedroom with a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù room located behind a bookshelf (where some folks believe the ghost of Wally resides). After taking in the entry levelget in the elevator and start your stay.On the second floor you will be thrilled to find a wonderful loungedining area and fully stocked kitchen with all new state of the art appliances and cookware. The view is nothing short of stunning as walls are in fact mostly windows revealing the entire Pacific Ocean. Slide open the doors and walk around the entire tower or simply sit on the deck and enjoy the view of the beach and Catalina. This is the lowest indoor floor of the Water Toweryet you are still 60 feet in the air with a majestic view. Throughout the Tower you will find a number of treats and architectural gems including magnificent stained glass windows and custom wood-work. This floor is no exception. Look up at the ceiling or simply give a listen for the whistle of the trains circling around the ceiling. These trains are replicas of those serviced by the Water Tower over a century ago. The lounge has not only amazing scenerybut we believe some of the most comfortable chairs you will ever have the pleasure of sitting in as you enjoy the view and your stay. This floor also hosts a bedroom with bunk beds dedicated and decorated in recognition of a little know part of California history ‚Äì Pirates. That‚Äôs rightPirates. SpecificallyHippolyte Bouchard who after raiding Montereyplundered Mission San Juan Capistrano while cruising up and down the coastline.A short trip up the beautiful winding staircase leads to the two master suites. Facing towards Los Angeles you will find the Whale Lovers Bedroom with a view of Huntington HarborBay of Los Angeles and White‚Äôs Point which is the land jetting-out from the end of San Pedro to form the outline of our Los Angeles coastline. This room not only has all new fine linenbut a world class shower sunken with an equally impressive view to enjoy while you experience this wonderful rain shower. On the other side of the floor you will find the Dolphin Bedroom with a view towards Huntington and Newport Beaches. We think you will find this suite equally impressive with unapparelled views and a bathroom shower with a view of the San Gabriel Mountains. All bedrooms are equipped with brand new HD televisions with Direct TV.Now it is time to journey to the top floor or Rotunda Room of the Water Tower. This room which stands over 80 feet above sea level offers a 360-degree view of all of southern California. From the Hollywood sign to San Clemente Island for as far as the eyes can see you will have an unobstructed view. If for some reason that is not enough for youwe have numerous magnifying devices including a custom-made viewfinder so if you are curious about what the crew of a passing sailboat looks likejust zoom in and take a gander. The room itself is designed to entertain and be enjoyed by up to 20 people. There are four large screen curved HD televisions so you can watch all the games. Or if you simply want to sit on the custom leather chairs or new couch and enjoy the view then don‚Äôt forget to take in the 100 gallon fish tank or be certain to look up at the stain glass ceiling. As you look up you will see propellers. Those too are part of the history of the tower and its unique role as a coastal landmark during World War II. This floor includes a custom barvideo station with over 600 different games and a lifetime of breathtaking views.Now that you have seen a glimpse of the inside of the Water Tower Experiencewe invite you to think about spending a little time on the exterior. Just a few short steps and you will find yourself on an elevated outdoor deck 50 feet above the ground with everything you need to enjoy the views and the beach without stepping off the lot. The deck boasts not only a jacuzzi and BBQbut also the amazing Breakfast Bar perfect to take in the sunrise orour favoritethe Sunset Bar which provides perhaps the best view of the sunset over Catalina in all the land. Indeedwe would put a view of the sunset from the Water Towerup against any other on the planet ‚Äì it is that spectacular.Of coursewe do not expect you to spend all of your beach vacation indoors so we have provided beach cruisersstand up paddleboardsbody boards and an array of beach toys. While you are less than 50 yards from the beachwe also provide a wagon so you can pack your toys for an easy jaunt to one of the best beaches on could ever hope to enjoy.""","['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Dryer', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Hot tub', 'Lift', 'The home or building has a lift that‚Äôs at least 52 inches (132cm) deep and a doorway at least 32 inches (81cm) wide.', 'Services', 'Self check-in', 'Keypad', 'Check yourself in to the home with a door code', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance', 'Unavailable: Heating\nHeating']",Seal Beach California United States,9,5.0,3.5,876,4.7,5.0,4.9,5.0,4.9,4.7,19.0,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/30321967?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8225&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-05-30&check_out=2022-06-06&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=5a234b9f-ba93-42d8-8853-79e87ba16031,4,

Location-location!! 4 miles to townThe space""The space.Architecturally elegant and unique design situated with beautiful views. This was a big home that has been duplex-ed and is about 1100 square feet. It was designed for privacyso the entry door for the other home is on the opposite side of the house from where you enter. Very peaceful and quiet - the only house on the street. I call the area country suburbia with houses peppered in the neighborhood about 1/4 mile away. This is a monolithic dome which means a huge balloon was blown up and sprayed with concrete before the balloon was popped. That part of the house is 34 ft diameter with rustic wooden floors & two 5 1/2 ft round windows over looking great views & yard. (The yard is not totally secure for pet safety.) Large kitchenvery roomy open plan space; king bed/queen bed in the lofta smart TV and selection of DVDs for your entertainment. The picture shows a ladder going to the loft but it is now a stair case. The loft has an artsy 2 1/2 foot picket fence as a wall. There is sight privacybut due to it being a half wallthere is no sound privacy. Parents note: Please look at the pictures to decide if this room is child-safe for your needs. About 2 % of folks decide its not right for them.I imagine it should be no problem unless they are climbers when youre not looking! Please ask for details if youre unsure. This is a wonderful space for retreatswritingmeditationyogadancingplayingfun! The sister dome is about 1000 square feet - and renting both sides is excellent for smallish events/retreats. There have been a few weddings held here.

This large house has entertained our family and friends for generationsand we‚Äôre thrilled that now you can share it with yourstoo. Be in nature but minutes from downtown!The spaceThe space.Our grandpa designed and built this unique home in a way that captures the rugged terrain on which it sits and compliments the stunning natural beauty of the Colorado National Monument that serves as the backdrop. He made it so every room has its own stunning view. Look closely at the photos to see the rock and wood detail throughout. The sandstone slab of the hill on which it‚Äôs built actually makes up the entire wall of the downstairs family room and the floor of the room above. Grandpa had artistic visioncreativityand the craftsmanship to put it all together and he built this house from his heart. (He was still building furniture for us well into his 90s!). It has served as a cherished place for family gatheringsand we invite you to enjoy your vacation the way we have enjoyed this home throughout the generations. Have breakfast in the kitchen or on the giant deckwhile enjoying unobstructed views of the Colorado National Monument and the way the morning sun hits the red rocks. Spend evenings by the massive fireplace watching the sun set over the Bookcliffs and the Grand Valley. During the summers you might catch a lightning storm over the grand valley as the thunder echoes off the massive canyon walls behind the house. We also have a charcoal grill so you can BBQ outside and take in the views from the deck. Take leisurely walks through the neighborhood or drive/bike to get to everything that Grand Junction has to offer. (See list below!)See our video tour: search ""House on the Rock"" and ""Grand Junction"" on that big video platform that everyone uses (stated in a way that gets around a ban on mentioning websites here). :)While most of the home furnishings are rustic and cozy in a way that preserves the years of fond memorieswe made sure you had enough upgraded guest amenities to make your stay as comfy as can be: we just remodeled our showershave hotel-quality linensplush towelsand plenty of toiletries.

Brown to design a bespokeone-of-a kind home. One that embraced the tenets of the modern movementresponded to the environmental conditions of the Sonoran Desert and offered both beauty and function.The result was an architectural masterpiece - considered one of the most important buildings of Browns design career.

The south facing floor-to-ceiling windows shed light on the authentic mid-century interior. Bold original colors are punctuated by pale wood finishes and earth toned polished concrete floors.

The property retains its classic charm. The 1200 sq. ft. architectural plan is based on the geometry of the hex - featuring two bedrooms plus a shared bathroom. Much of the original modernist furniture by George Nelson for Herman Miller and custom Tucson furniture maker John Kelso are extant.
